Murmur (formerly project Rangzen) is an open-source, anonymous messaging app that does not require an Internet connection. Messages are not sent in real-time like with other messaging apps that rely on the Internet and have a central server, but instead spread directly from one device to another (forming a peer-to-peer network) without user intervention using Bluetooth and WiFi Direct. The more devices the faster the message spreads! If no device is around, the message is queued in the feed to be sent later. You control your anonymity and decide what information to share about yourself. Lastly, Connection Scores help you filter spam messages and Restricted Messages limit your audience to your friends.

## Security Audit
Murmur (Rangzen) passed a full 3rd party security audit by iSEC, see docs for the report outputs. All major findings have been resolved.
